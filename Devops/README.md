## Our First Repository

This module gets you started using Git. It provides the foundation for the rest of the course. You will install Git and/or Sourcetree, create a local repository, create a commit, create a remote repository and push commits to a remote repository. You have the option of doing the hands-on labs using the Sourcetree graphical Git client and/or using a command line. 

## Branching and Merging I

This module discusses to of the key concepts involved with Git: branching and merging. It starts with foundational knowledge on Git's commit graph model, Git IDs and references. Branching and merging are then covered, including the difference between fast-forward merges and using merge commits.

## Branching and Merging II

This module continues the discussion of branching and merging. It starts with resolving a merge conflict. Then synchronizing with remote repositories is covered, including the fetch, pull and push commands. The other major topic of this module is rewriting history. The commit history is an important part of a project. A clean commit history makes it easier to understand the project, and then contribute to it by adding new features or fixing problems. If you have not shared your commits, you can rewrite them in a way that makes a cleaner 

## Git Workflows

This module covers topics on how teams work with Git. Git is flexible enough to work with many types of projects and teams. The better you understand Git's capabilities, the more effectively to can use it in your projects. Topics include pull requests, centralized workflows, feature branch workflows, forking workflows and Gitflow workflows. This module concludes with a project in which you use Git with a Gitflow workflow.
