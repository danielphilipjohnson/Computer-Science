The IMPORTS section makes available all the Python modules to be used later. It
also defines EmailConfig namedtuple to help with handling the email
parameters.

READ TEMPLATES retrieves the email templates and stores them for later use in
the EMAIL_TEMPLATE and EMAIL_STYLING constants.
The __main__ block starts the process by, getting the configuration parameters,
parsing the config file, and then calling the main function.
The main function combines the other functions. First, it retrieves the articles,
and then it obtains the body and sends the email.
get_articles walks through all the feeds, discards any article that is over a
week old, retrieves each of them, and searches for a match on the keywords. All
the matched articles are returned, including information about the link and a
summary.

compose_email_body uses the email templates to compile the email body.
Notice that the template is in Markdown and it gets parsed into HTML, to give
the same information in plain-text and in HTML.
send_email gets the body information, as well as required info such as the
username/password, and finally sends the email.
