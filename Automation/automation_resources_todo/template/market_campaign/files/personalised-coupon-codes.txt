1. Detect the best moment to launch the campaign
2. Generate individual codes to be sent to potential customers
3. Send the codes directly to users over their preferred channel, text message or
email
4. Collect the results of the campaign
5. Generate a sales report with analysis of the results


After an opportunity is detected, we decide to generate a campaign for all customers. To
direct promotions and avoid duplication, we will generate a million unique coupons,
divided into three batches:
Half of the codes will be printed and distributed in a marketing action
300,000 codes will be reserved to be used later if the campaign hits some goals
The remainder 200,000 will be directed to customers through SMS and emails, as
we will see later


These coupons can be redeemed in the online system. Our task will be to generate the
proper codes, which should meet the following requirements:
The codes need to be unique
The codes need to be printable and easy to read, as some customers will be
dictating them over the phone
There should be a quick way of discarding codes before checking them (avoiding
spam attacks)
The codes should be presented in a CSV format for printing
