# Automating Tasks Made Easy

It all starts with defining exactly what task needs to be run, and designing it in a way that
doesn't require human intervention to run.

## Some ideal characteristic points are as follows:
1. Single, clear entry point: No confusion on what the task to run is.
2. Clear parameters: If there are any parameters, they should be very explicit.
3. No interactivity: Stopping the execution to request information from the user is
not possible.
4. The result should be stored: To be able to be checked at a different time than
when it runs.
5. Clear result: If we are working interactively in a result, we accept more verbose
results, or progress reports. But, for an automated task, the final result should be
as concise and to the point as possible.
6. Errors should be logged: To analyze what went wrong.
