Background

As you know, it is important to provide different views for varying viewports. This can be done using your own media queries and style rules. In this assignment you will take code provided by me, and add two additional views. You may not modify the HTML file in any way.

Starting Point

Here is picture of your starting point. Don't worry if it looks a little bit different, don't worry about it -- it is probably due to differences in the default browser styling.
