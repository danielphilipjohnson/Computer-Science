# Portfolio Grading Rubric

I hope that people will be more concerned with their learning than their grade on this assignment. But I understand that people want to make sure they receive full credit so I will provide the grading rubric that will be used. Feel free to structure your page around it.

- Does the site validate? 10pts
- Is the site responsive? 20pts
- Is the site well-styled? 10pts
- Are the images incorporated effectively? 5pts
- Successfully demonstrated the ability to enhance their site? 40pts

## Does the site validate?

- 10pts – Fully validates (warnings are fine)
- 8 pts – There are errors, but the student has shown (in their write-up or video) that they are caused by plugins and can not be fixed.
- 6 pts – There are at most 3 errors for the entire site
- 3pts – They have only shown that part of the site validates. (For instance, only tested one of the files in a multi-file site.)
- 0 pts – More than three errors were left or the site was not tested at all.

## Is the site responsive?

- 20pts Yes, the site has a unique look/layout for each of the views.
- 10pts The site has a unique look, but not a unique layout. (For example, they changed only colors of fonts, not the actual layout.)
- 6pts Only some of the pages are responsive - not all of them.
- 0pts The site is not responsive

## Is the site well-styled?

This is very objective. It should be difficult to score a high score, but not difficult to receive the majority of the points. It is important that everyone create a unique style sheet, even if using a template or framework. Look for feedback in Week Five to improve your score.

- 10pts – The site is incredibly well-styled and the author went beyond the required (animation, hovering, etc done with CSS)
- 8pt – The site is very well-styled. The content has a layout that is easy to follow and a variety of colors and fonts were used. -- Most students can expect to receive this score.
- 4pts – The styling is lacking or the author relied almost exclusively on a template/framework.
- 0pts – Less than 9 unique CSS rules were used.

## Enhancements!!

You need to add four elements to your site that are unique – something beyond what we did in the four previous courses. You are encouraged to be as creative as you would like (and creative does not need to mean time-intensive). Some options for these "extras" include:

- Add custom JavaScript (e.g. incorporate dynamic content, use JS to perform verification, modify the DOM)
- Enhance the accessibility of your page (e.g. put your site through the some subset of the WebAim quick evaluation reference - http://webaim.org/resources/evalquickref/)
- Incorporate plugins (e.g. Google Calendar, a map, parallax, etc.) You will need to show what you did other than just copying code. Did you need to change any of the attributes? Change any of the links?
- Include a Carousel for your images (don't forget to turn off the automatic start feature if you can!!)
- Use a sticky footer to create a consistent look across different browser heights (we usually only consider widths…)
- Add a third viewport layout (e.g. a table view that is different than mobile or large-screen) 


Again, these are just suggestions, please feel free to let your own creativity be your guide.

Each extra will be worth 10 pts, for a total of 40 pts.
