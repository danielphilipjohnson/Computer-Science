This is it. I am letting go and letting you make something completely from scratch. Create your own responsive photo gallery and post it for others. (I gave you an example of a photo gallery in the Responsive Images lecture -- but now you can use your own images.) If you are feeling extra ambitious add a table too, one that uses Bootstrap classes for style. Don't forget to link that Bootstrap code!!

If you plan on uploading your files (instead of providing a link to CodePen), please use absolute links for your images. We don't want to require that people download too many files for grading.
