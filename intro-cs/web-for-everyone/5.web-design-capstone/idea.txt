There are lots of tools available to help you design for color-blind people:

    Check My Colours: if you have an existing website, you can just enter a URL and receive feedback of what needs to be improved.
    WebAim’s color contrast checker: provide two colors to see if they pass accessibility guidelines.
    I Want To See Like The Color Blind: apply color blindness filters to your web page right within Chrome.
    Color Oracle: a color blindness simulator for Windows, Mac and Linux, showing you what people with common color vision impairments will see
