# Using Python to Access Web Data by University of Michigan

## About this Course

This course will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data.  We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.  We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.  This course will cover Chapters 11-13 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”. To succeed in this course, you should be familiar with the material covered in Chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two courses in this specialization.  These topics include variables and expressions, conditional execution (loops, branching, and try/except), functions, Python data structures (strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples), and manipulating files.  This course covers Python 3.

## What you will learn

- Use regular expressions to extract data from strings
- Understand the protocols web browsers use to retrieve documents and web apps
- Retrieve data from websites and APIs using Python
- Work with XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data


## Skills you will gain
- Json
- Xml
- Python Programming
- Web Scraping

## Regular Expressions (Chapter 11)

Regular expressions are a very specialized language that allow us to succinctly search strings and extract data from strings. Regular expressions are a language unto themselves. It is not essential to know how to use regular expressions, but they can be quite useful and powerful.

### Assignments
- Regular Expressions
- Extracting Data With Regular Expressions


## Networks and Sockets (Chapter 12)
In this section we learn about the protocols that web browsers use to retrieve documents and web applications use to interact with Application Program Interfaces (APIs).

### Assignments
- Networks and Sockets
- Understanding the Request / Response Cycle


## Programs that Surf the Web (Chapter 12)
In this section we learn to use Python to retrieve data from web sites and APIs over the Internet.

### Assignments

## Web Services and XML (Chapter 13)
In this section, we learn how to retrieve and parse XML (eXtensible Markup Language) data.

### Assignments

- eXtensible Markup Language

## JSON and the REST Architecture (Chapter 13)
In this module, we work with Application Program Interfaces / Web Services using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format.

### Assignments
- REST, JSON, and APIs
- Extracting Data from JSON
- Using the GeoJSON API
