1. Setup your generated token into the telegram_bot.py script on the TOKEN
constant in line 6:

TOKEN = '<YOUR TOKEN>'

2. Start the bot:
$ python telegram_bot.py


3. Open the Telegram channel in your phone using the URL and start it. You can
use the help, offers, and events commands:


IMPORTS
TOKEN
# Define the information to return per command
def get_help():
def get_offers():
def get_events():

COMMANDS = {
    'help': get_help,
    'offers': get_offers,
    'events': get_events,
}

class MarketingBot(telepot.helper.ChatHandler):
# Create and start the bot



The MarketingBot class creates an interface to handle the communication with Telegram:
- When the channel is started, the open method will be called
- When a message is received, the on_chat_message method will be called
- If there's no answer in a while, on_idle will be called





In each case, the self.sender.sendMessage method is used to send a message back to
the user. Most of the interesting bits happen in on_chat_message:


def on_chat_message(self, msg):
    # If the data sent is not test, return an error
    content_type, chat_type, chat_id = telepot.glance(msg)
    if content_type != 'text':
        self.sender.sendMessage("I don't understand you. "
            "Please type 'help' for options")
        return
    # Make the commands case insensitive
    command = msg['text'].lower()

    if command not in COMMANDS:
        self.sender.sendMessage("I don't understand you. "
            "Please type 'help' for options")
        return
    message = COMMANDS[command]()
    self.sender.sendMessage(message)
