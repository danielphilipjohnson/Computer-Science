The shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, it provides functions that support file copying and removal. It comes under Python's standard utility modules. disk_usage() method is used to get disk usage statistics of the given path. This method returns a named tuple with the attributes total, used, and free. The total attribute represents the total amount of space, the used attribute represents the amount of used space, and the free attribute represents the amount of available space, in bytes.

psutil (Python system and process utilities) is a cross-platform library for retrieving information on the processes currently running and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python. It's useful mainly for system monitoring, profiling, limiting process resources, and managing running processes. cpu_percent() returns a float showing the current system-wide CPU use as a percentage. When the interval is 0.0 or None (default), the function compares process times to system CPU times elapsed since the last call, returning immediately (non-blocking). That means that the first time it's called it will return a meaningful 0.0 value. When the interval is > 0.0, the function compares process times to system CPU times elapsed before and after the interval (blocking).
