Introduction

You work for a company that sells second hand cars. Management wants to get a summary of the amounts of vehicles that have been sold at the end of every month. The company already has a web service which serves sales data at the end of every month but management wants an email to be sent out with an attached PDF so that data is more easily readable.
What you'll do

    Write a script that summarizes and processes sales data into different categories
    Generate a PDF using Python
    Automatically send a PDF by email



## Sales summary

This data is in a JSON file named car_sales.json. Let's have a look at it.

    cat car_sales.json


 here is an example of one of the JSON objects among the list.

 {
        "id": 47,
        "car": {
                "car_make": "Lamborghini",
                "car_model": "Murci√©lago",
                "car_year": 2002
        },
        "price": "$13724.05",
        "total_sales": 149
}


The script cars.py already contains part of the work, but learners need to complete the task by writing the remaining pieces. The script already calculates the car model with the most revenue (price * total_sales) in the process_data method.


Learners need to add the following:

1. Calculate the car model which had the most sales by completing the process_data method, and then appending a formatted string to the summary list in the below format:

- "The {car model} had the most sales: {total sales}"

2. Calculate the most popular car_year across all car make/models (in other words, find the total count of cars with the car_year equal to 2005, equal to 2006, etc. and then figure out the most popular year) by completing the process_data method, and append a formatted string to the summary list in the below format:

- "The most popular year was {year} with {total sales in that year} sales."



## The challenge

Here, you are going to update the script cars.py. You will be using the above JSON data to process information. A part of the script is already done for you, where it calculates the car model with the most revenue (price * total_sales). You should now fulfil the following objectives with the script:



1. Calculate the car model which had the most sales.
    a. Call format_car method for the car model.

2. Calculate the most popular car_year across all car make/models.

Grant required permissions to the file cars.py and open it using nano editor.

    sudo chmod o+wx ~/scripts/cars.py

    nano ~/scripts/cars.py






### Generate PDF and send Email

Once the data is collected, you will also need to further update the script to generate a PDF report and automatically send it through email.

To generate a PDF:

- Use the reports.generate() function within the main function.

- The report should be named as cars.pdf, and placed in the folder /tmp/.

- The PDF should contain:
    - A summary paragraph which contains the most sales/most revenue/most popular year values worked out in the previous step.
    - A table which contains all the information parsed from the JSON file, organised by id_number. The car details should be combined into one column in the form <car_make> <car_model> (<car_year>).


#### To send the PDF through email:

Once the PDF is generated, you need to send the email, using the emails.generate() and emails.send() methods.

Use the following details to pass the parameters to emails.generate():

- From: automation@example.com
- To: <user>@example.com
- Subject line: Sales summary for last month
- E-mail Body: The same summary from the PDF, but using \n between the lines
- Attachment: Attach the PDF path i.e. generated in the previous step


Once you have completed editing cars.py script, save the file by typing Ctrl-o, Enter key, and Ctrl-x.

Run the cars.py script, which will generate mail to their user.

    ./cars.py


## Congratulations!

Congrats! You've successfully written a Python script to automatically generate a PDF and send it through email.
