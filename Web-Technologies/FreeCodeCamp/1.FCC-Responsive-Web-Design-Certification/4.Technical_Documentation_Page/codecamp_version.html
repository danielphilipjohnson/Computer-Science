            <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, but is also influenced by Awk, Perl and Python. JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a
                variable name.</p>
            <code>
                <span class="var">var</span> Früh = "foobar";
            </code>
            <p>
                But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is case sensitive. In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;). A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line.
                But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons. ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more information, see the detailed reference
                about JavaScript's lexical grammar.) It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code. The source
                text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered
                whitespace.

                Comments
            </header>

            <p>The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
            </p>
            <code>
                <span class="comment">// a one line comment</span>
                <br>
                <span class="comment">
                    /* this is a longer,
                    <br>
                    * multi-line comment
                    */
                </span>
                <br>
                <span class="comment">
                    /* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */
                </span>
            </code>
            <p>Comments behave like whitespace and are discarded during script execution.

                <p> You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. </p>
                <p> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and
                    the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). </p>
                <p> You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers (for more details see this blog post). You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.
                </p>
                <p>Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.</p>

                <p class="sub-header">Declaring variables</p>
                <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.
                    </li>
                    <li>With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. See Variable scope below. You can also simply assign a value to a variable For example, x = 42. This form creates
                        an undeclared global variable. It also generates a strict JavaScript warning. Undeclared global variables can often lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, it is discouraged to use undeclared global variables.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p class="sub-header"> Evaluating variables</p>
                <p>A variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the value of undefined. An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a ReferenceError exception being thrown:

                </code>

                <p>You can use undefined to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable input is not assigned a value, and the if statement evaluates to true.</p>
                <code>
                    <span class="var">var</span> input;
                    <span class="if">if</span> (input === undefined) {
                    <br>
                    doThis();
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    <span class="if">else</span> {
                    doThat();
                    }
                </code>
                <p>The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context. For example, the following code executes the function myFunction because the myArray element is undefined:</p>
                <code>
                    <span class="var">var</span> myArray = [];
                    <br>
                    <span class="if">if</span> (!myArray[0])

                    <span class="keyword"> myFunction();</span>
                </code>
                <p>The undefined value converts to NaN when used in numeric context. </p>
                <code>
                    <span class="var">var</span> a;
                    <br>
                    a + 2; <span class="comment">// Evaluates to NaN</span>
                </code>
                <p>When you evaluate a null variable, the null value behaves as 0 in numeric contexts and as false in boolean contexts. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    <span class="var">var</span> n = null;
                    <br>
                    console.<span class="keyword">log</span>(n * 32); <span class="comment">// Will log 0 to the
                        console</span>

                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
                    only within that function. JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
                    following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the global context (or the function if the following codes are part of the function), not the immediate if statement block.</p>
                <code>

                    <span class="if">if</span> (true) {
                    <span class="var">var</span> x = 5;
                    }
                    console.<span class="keyword">log</span>(x); <span class="comment">// x is 5</span>

                </code>
                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015. </p>
                <code>
                    <span class="if">if</span> (true) {

                <p class="sub-header">Variable hoisting</p>
                <p>Another unusual thing about variables in JavaScript is that you can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception. This concept is known as hoisting; variables in JavaScript are in a sense "hoisted" or lifted to the
                    top of the function or statement. However, variables that are hoisted return a value of undefined. So even if you declare and initialize after you use or refer to this variable, it still returns undefined.

                <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to

                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign ($) and can contain alphabetic, numeric,
                    or underscore characters.</p>

                <code> const PI = 3.14; </code>
                <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It must be initialized to a value.</p>
                <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block-scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:

                <p>However, the properties of objects assigned to constants are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>

                    Also, the contents of an array are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
                </p>
                <code>
                    const MY_ARRAY = ['HTML','CSS'];

                Data structures and types
            </header>
            <p class="sub-header">Data types</p>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values,
                and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">

            <header>
                if...else statement
            </header>
            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>

            <code><span class="if">if</span> (condition) { statement_1; } <span class="if">else </span> { statement_2;
                }</code>
            <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and
                statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
            <p>
                You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
            </p>
            <code><span class="if">if</span> (condition_1) {
                <br>
                statement_1;
                <br>
                } <span class="if">else if</span> (condition_2) {
                <br>
                statement_2;
                <br>
                } <span class="if">else if</span> (condition_n) {
                <br>
                statement_n;
                <br>
                } else {
                <br>
                statement_last;
                <br>
                }
            </code>

            <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block
                statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>

            <code><span class="if">if</span> (condition) {
                <br>
                statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                <br>
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                }
                <br>
                <span class="if">else</span> {
                <br>
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                <br>
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;

                }
            </code>
            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
            </p>
            <code><span class="if">if</span> (x = y) { <span class="comment">/* statements here */ </span>}</code>
            <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>

            <code><span class="if">if</span> ((x = y)) { <span class="comment">/* statements here */</span> }</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="While_statement">
            <header>
                While statement
            </header>

            <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>

            <code><span class="while">while</span> (condition)
                statement</code>

            <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>

            <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement
                following while.</p>

            <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.</p>

            <p>Example:</p>

            <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

            <code>
                <span class="var">var</span> n = 0;
                <br>
                <span class="var">var</span> x = 0;
                <br>
                <span class="while">while</span> (n < 3) { n++; x +=n; }
            </code>
            <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
            </ul>

            <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.
            </p>

            <header>
                Function declarations
            </header>
            <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</P>

            <code><span class="keyword">function</span> square(number) { <span class="keyword">return</span> number *
                number; }</code>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the
                function.
            </p>
            <code>
                <span class="keyword">return</span>
                number * number;
            </code>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
