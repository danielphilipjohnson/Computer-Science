# Portfolio Objectives

Your first step is to think about what type of portfolio you would like to make. Will it be about you? How do you want to lay out the content? What is the story you are trying to tell or the information you are trying to convey. The second step will be to consider the different development options (from scratch, from a template, and/or utilizing a development framework). There is no "best" topic or option other than the one that works best for your Web Design Goals. Next week you can submit a wireframe/sketch for your proposed portfolio. But before you get started I will outline the criteria for passing this course.

Upon completion of this course you will :

- Create a series of wireframes for your site (also referred to as "portfolio")
- Generate original content
- Use the proper semantic and syntactic HTML tags to display your content
- Apply CSS to your content to create a stylish and accessible site
- Write media queries and/or use a framework to create a responsive site
- Implement four "extras" that demonstrate the ability to apply web design theory or practice (JavaScript, plugins, Accessibility features, animation, etc.)

The challenge of a peer-graded project is that not everyone agrees on the "right" amount of content, styling, etc. Therefore in Week Five of the course you have an option to submit an optional peer-graded assignment to get feedback. In Week Six you can submit your work along with a write-up of any changes you made based on earlier feedback.
Final submission:

How will you submit your final submission? It would be great if we could all host our sites and check them out. However, I do not feel comfortable requiring students to go to unapproved sites. So your final submission will be a a URL (for those who wish to host their site) or a a student-created video that walks your peers through your incredible creation.****
