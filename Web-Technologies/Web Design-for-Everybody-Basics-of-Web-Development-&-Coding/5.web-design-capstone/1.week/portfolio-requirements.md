Portfolio Requirements

At long last you can stop styling sites about Ultimate Frisbee and get to something that you have a personal interest in. (My apologies to you actual Ultimate Frisbee fanatics.) While the content of your site is COMPLETELY UP TO YOU, there will be requirements on the structure.

Each portfolio must:

    Have at least three "pages." These can can be three different html files, or one file that links to all three "pages". Here is an example:

Single file: Clicking on the navigation links will take you to a specific section in a page.

http://winespto.org/ (Note, this page may take some time to load. This is due to the donation plug-in.)

Multiple files: Clicking on the navigation links will take you to a different file

As you make your choice, think about any accessibility issues that may come along with your implementation. You will not have time to make a "perfect" site (no one ever does), but I am concerned with you making informed decisions.

    Each page must have at least two semantic tags (header, nav, footer, etc)
    Each page must validate at validator.w3.org.
    Each page must be responsive -- there must be at least two unique views
    You must have at least 4 images on one of your pages. (If this requirement doesn't "fit" your portfolio plan, please just make an extra page that fulfills it. You can always unlink it after you have been peer -graded.
    Each page must be styled. The goal is not to impress, but to show competence. So add enough to show that you know how to write CSS rules. But peer-review with the knowledge that not everything will be beautiful.
