# Building your site from scratch

Do you want to create the bulk of your project from scratch? This is the option for you. Students will design and style their site without the help of a blueprint or template. While it is likely they may add some plug-ins (a google map, a carousel, etc.) the bulk of the code will be their own original work. In all honesty, the sites created using this option may appear to be less impressive than other options, but there is a huge opportunity for learning.

In order to fulfill the requirements you will need to write your own media queries so make sure you review that topic before you get started. Feel free to head back to the entire Responsive Design course, or just these two videos that addressed media queries directly.

I am excited to see how many students utilize this option
