# Assessing the Design Sketches

It is time to present and review design sketches. Before you do either I want you to make sure you consider the following:

- Was there a mobile view?
- Was there at least one other view?
- How different were the two views? Remember, a mobile view is not a "smaller" version of a site. There are usually structural changes that allow you to retain the content but enhance the experience.

Submit and review submissions that match your intended implementation choice. Two people who are both creating their sites from scratch are more likely to appreciate each other's work than a student who is using a template or framework.

For the review, please provide some comments. What is the best part of their design? Do you envision any challenges the author may have? Are there any accessibility issues you picked up on?
