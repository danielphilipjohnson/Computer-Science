# Final Project

**This homework is also described in a video lecture. Make sure to watch it to get a better feel for what I am looking for.
Objectives:

- Create a style sheet and link it to the html files. (Without changing the html.)
- Style the sheet using the properties we covered in lecture. There is a particular emphasis on pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes. 
- There is an opportunity to use some properties we didnâ€™t cover in class. For instance, we want to style on the first element of each row to be left-aligned. The rest should be centered. 

## Steps:

Style the following:

- The table should be styled using at least four properties
- The table headings should have a thicker bottom border with the top two corners rounded, a background color, and at least one other property
- Style the table so that the text in the first column is left-aligned and the text in the other two columns is centered
- Set the opacity of the table rows to a value between .6 and .8 (make sure it is still visible)
- Change the opacity of a row when it is hovered over
- The table elements <td> should be styled using at least four properties

## Review criteria

You will review each submission based on whether each objective/style is achieved or not, and at what level. (For instance, did they put in background-color and if so, did they use hexadecimal or rgb.)

Specifically, you will evaluate submissions by answering the following questions:

- Is the table element styled?
- Are the table headings properly styled?
- Are ONLY the corners of the table styled?
- Does the opacity of a table row change when it is hovered over?
- Are the table elements styled?
