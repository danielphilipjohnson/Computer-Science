# Homework Two: Advanced Selectors

**This homework is also described in a video lecture. Make sure to watch it to get a better feel for what I am looking for.
Objectives:

- Create a style sheet and link it to the html files. (Without changing the html.)
- Style the sheet using the properties we covered in lecture.
- Consider using some elements we didn’t cover, or didn’t cover well. You can search for the options online, or you can watch the videos from Week Four for some pointers. 

## Steps:
- Download the image from http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/images/flywheel.jpg and put it into a folder named images.
Style the following:
- The body should have padding and margin
- The header should have a background color, background image (using a local image), and padding
- The navigation links (and only the links in the navigation) should be styled with a new display, margin, border-radius, text-decoration, and padding
- The link to the current page should be styled differently from the other links (using class = "active')
- The sections should be next to each other, not one on top of the other.
- The images should be part of the page now. In addition, they should have a border, be centered horizontally, and have vertical (top/bottom) space between them and the other images.


## Review criteria

You will review each submission based on whether each objective/style is achieved or not, and at what level. (For instance, did they put in background-color and if so, did they use hexadecimal or rgb.)

Specifically, you will use evaluate submissions by answering the following questions:

- Does the body have padding and or margin?
- Is the header styled?
- Are ONLY the links in navigation styled, not the other links?
- Are the links styled?
- Is the “active” class styled to clearly show which page is the current page?
- Are the two sections side-by-side?
- Are the images styled?
