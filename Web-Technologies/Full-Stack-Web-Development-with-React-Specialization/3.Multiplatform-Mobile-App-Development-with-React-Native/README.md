# Multiplatform Mobile App Development with React Native

## by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology

This course focuses on developing truly cross-platform, native iOS and Android apps using React Native (Ver 0.55) and the Expo SDK (Ver. 27.0.0). React Native uses modern JavaScript to get truly native UI and performance while sharing skills and code with the web. You will learn about UI development with React Native UI and layout support and access the native mobile platform's capabilities from Javascript using the Expo SDK. You should have already completed the Bootstrap 4 and the React courses in this specialization before proceeding with this course.

At the end of this course you will be able to (a) Build mobile applications targeting multiple platforms with a single codebase, (b) Leverage your React and Javascript skills, (c) Use various features of React Native and the Expo SDK to build truly cross-platform mobile applications, and (d) Use Redux to design the architecture for a React-Redux application


### Skills you will gain
- Bootstrap (Front-End Framework)
- Node.Js
- React (Javascript Library)
- Redux
- Jquery
- SASS (Stylesheet Language)
- Authentication
- Mongodb
- Express.Js


## Week 1: Multiplatform Mobile App Development with React Native: An Introduction

This module introduces you to hybrid mobile application development. You will learn about React Native and explore some of the features of React Native to implement a mobile app based on the React application that was implemented in the previous course on React.

- Graded: React Native Components and Navigation

## Week 2: React Native UI Elements and Redux

This module introduces you to various React Native UI elements. We will look at how we can make use of these elements in designing the various views of our application. You will get an overview of the Flux architecture and introduced to Redux as a way of realizing the Flux architecture

- Graded: React Native UI Elements and Redux
- Graded: UI Design and Prototyping

Week 3: React Native Alerts, Animations, Gestures, and Persist Redux Store
In this module we look at enhancing the user experience through the use of animations and support for gesture-based interaction. We also look at persisting the redux state, and alerting the users

- Graded: Alerts, Animations, Gestures, and Persist Redux Store

## Week 4: Accessing Native Capabilities of Devices: The Expo SDK

In this module you will explore the Expo SDK that enables you to access the native capabilities of the mobile devices. You will use a few SDK APIs in order to understand the general concepts and the patterns for using these APIs within your React Native application

- Graded: Accessing Native Capabilities of Devices: The Expo SDK
- Graded: Project Implementation and Final Report
