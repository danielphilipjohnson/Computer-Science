# JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON

## About this Course

In this course, we'll look at the JavaScript language, and how it supports the Object-Oriented pattern, with a focus on the unique aspect of how JavaScript approaches OO. We'll explore a brief introduction to the jQuery library, which is widely used to do in-browser manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling. You'll also learn more about JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which is commonly used as a syntax to exchange data between code running on the server (i.e. in PHP) and code running in the browser (JavaScript/jQuery).

It is assumed that learners have already taken the Building Web Applications and Building Database Applications in PHP courses in this specialization.

## Skills you will gain
- Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)
- Jquery
- JavaScript

## Week 1: Introduction to JavaScript

We take a quick look at the JavaScript language. We assume that you already know PHP - so it is a pretty quick introduction focusing on what is different about JavaScript.

## Week 2: JavaScript Objects

We do a quick look at how the JavaScript language supports the Object-Oriented pattern. This is the second time we look at the OO pattern so we focus on the unique aspect of how JavaScript approaches OO.

## Week 3: Using JQuery

This is a brief introduction to the JQuery library which is widely used to do in-browser manipulation of the Document Object Model(DOM) and event handling.

## Week 4: JSON - JavaScript Object Notation

In this section we look at JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON is commonly used as a syntax to exchange data between code running on the server (i.e. in PHP) and code running in the browser (JavaScript/JQuery).
